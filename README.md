# debug.css â€“ v1.0

Debug CSS is a small, standalone, stylesheet to help visually identify invalid and potentially inaccessible markup, *during development*.

It based entirely upon a portion of the excellent [inuit.css](https://github.com/csswizardry/inuit.css/) (a powerful little framework designed for _serious_ developers) by [Harry Roberts](https://github.com/csswizardry), and all credit should go to him.

I simply broke out Inuit's _debug.scss and implemented it as a stand-alone stylesheet so that it can be quickly and easily linked to from any project to aid in fast visual debugging.

## Usage

Simply include a link to the stylesheet in the head (i.e. before the </head>) of your document, like so:

    <link href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattl/debug-css/main/debug.css" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />

**Heads up: Don't forget to remove the link to debug.css once you've finished debugging.**

If there are potential issues, you'll see some more colour on your site:

 * Red          ==      definite error
 * Yellow       ==      double-check

You can then simply check with your browser tools to see why that colour style is being applied.


## Credits

Credit should go to [inuit.css](https://github.com/csswizardry/inuit.css/) creator, [Harry Roberts](https://github.com/csswizardry) for the original _debug.scss in that framework.

Thanks also to [@pjkix](https://github.com/pjkix) for adding the bookmarklet above.
